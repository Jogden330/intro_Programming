Error.log file
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Just BASIC will log hard errors in this file.  This means that as a
user of Just BASIC, you will probably not be able to understand
much of what you read here.  More than anything, this information is
useful to the makers of Just BASIC.  When you have an error notice
that mentions it has added information to this file, please make sure
to gather this information when reporting a problem to Shoptalk
Systems.  The information has date and time information, and new
information is always added to the end of the file, so you do not
need to send the whole file, but just the part related to the problem
you are experiencing.  Send a detailed explanation about how to
reproduce the problem along with a small example program if possible
and also the error.log information to support@justbasic.com

Thanks!
